### Juice WRLD makes listening to unreleased leaks on Discord easy!

Simply enter `/stream station>` to begin listening to the **Leaks** station, which contains previously unreleased Juice WRLD songs. We currently only have one massive playlist full of unreleased songs from every era (DRFL, GB&GD, JuiceTheKid, and so on), but we are slowly working on an algorithm to separate each era into its own station.

You can use `/stats` to view the current shard's statistics to see what's currently playing on all the stations, how many people your shard is serving, and more.
